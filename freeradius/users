# This is our FreeRADIUS users file where the actual users are defined along with the parameters
# to be pushed to the clients (network devices).
#
# In production we would typically use an upstream user store such as LDAP or AD.
#
# Important fields briefly explained:
#
# user1 = username
# password = password
# 
# Tunnel-Private-Group-ID:
# VLAN ID or name that the user will be placed in after successful authentication
# 
# Cisco TrustSec parameters:
#
# Cisco-AVPair = "cts:vn=Campus":
# The Cisco Software-Defined Access Virtual Network (VN) that is pushed to the client. (OPTIONAL)
#
# Cisco-AVPair += "cts:security-group-tag=0016-00"
# The Scalalable (or Security) Group Tag (SGT) that will be assigned to the user's traffic.
# Note1: The SGT is in HEX format and can be obtained from Cisco DNA Center or Cisco ISE.
# Note2: The "-00" following the SGT is the SGT Generation and can be obtained from Cisco ISE.
